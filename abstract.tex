Recent interest in mobile Internet has resulted in increasing measurement studies 
about data generated by personal devices such as smartphones and tablets. 
However, the privacy and security challenges brought by the data has also 
increased dramatically, and have created obstacles to 
sharing resources and data among mobile devices. In this paper we introduce \sysname, a testbed using 
security and privacy techniques that ensure the security of user-owned devices, and the 
privacy of user-generated data. The usage model of \sysname is unique in that 
it both manages how device owners make their devices accessible to the 
research community, and offers technical resources to researchers
that allow them to collect data from remote mobile devices. 

\sysname mediates the process for device owners to make 
their devices available while preserving their privacy, and enables 
researchers to securely experiment with end user mobile device and 
data. We achieve these by integrating privacy techniques with IRB 
process at the researcher's institution, and using a secure sandbox 
to execute experiment on device owners' personal devices. 
As a result, \sysname will lower the barriers for researchers to 
perform research experiment on end-users' mobile devices.
